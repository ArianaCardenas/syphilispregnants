Study description
This retrospective epidemiological study was conducted using Peruvian secondary data on reported cases of congenital and maternal syphilis, and percentage of syphilis screening to evaluated the progress in the Peruvian context at the national and departmental levels towards the following WHO goals: (1) reducing the incidence of congenital syphilis in ≤ 0.5 cases per 1000 live births, (2) 30% reduction in the incidence of maternal syphilis between 2018 and 2030, and (3) 95% coverage of syphilis screening during pregnancy. In 2022, nationwide syphilis screening during pregnancy was 82.6% (95% CI: 80.7%  - 84.5%), the congenital syphilis rate was 0.82 cases per 1000 live births, and the maternal syphilis rates increased by 53.7% from 2018. At the department level, only one department achieved all goals; 11, either goal (1) or (2); one, both goals (1) and (2); and 12, neither goal. Eight departments doubled their maternal syphilis rates in 2022 compared to 2018. Additionally, in 2022, sub-departments with the highest proportions (third tertile) of women with low education and no ANC had the highest national average rate of congenital syphilis. This study found that none of the WHO's Syphilis MTCT goals were met in Peru in 2022. Strengthening decentralized prevention strategies, such as scaling up syphilis screening, improving access to ANC, and promoting community engagement within national policies, is essential to reversing current trends and eliminating congenital and maternal syphilis by 2030.
